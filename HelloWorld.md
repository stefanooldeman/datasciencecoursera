## This is a markdown file


this is a block of code
```
âžœ  datasciencecoursera git:(master) git remote -vv
origin  https://github.com/stefanooldeman/datasciencecoursera.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/stefanooldeman/datasciencecoursera.git (push)
```

this is *bold* and this is _italic_. Nothing beats plain text.

> Half the world is composed of people who have something to say and can't, and the other half who have nothing to say and keep on saying it.
